# Automatic Drainage Solenoid Valve for Air Compressor

Automate your air compressor's drainage process with our innovative solution.

## Overview

This open-source project offers an efficient way to automate the drainage of condensate from air compressors. Our system is powered by microcontrollers, controlling a solenoid valve to release accumulated condensate automatically. This improves overall compressor performance and significantly reduces maintenance efforts.

## Key Features

- **Automation**: No need for manual drainage. Our system does it for you.
- **Improved Performance**: Efficient condensate removal enhances compressor efficiency.
- **Maintenance Reduction**: Less manual intervention means reduced maintenance.
- **Customization**: Easily adapt our solution to various compressor setups.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed with user convenience in mind.

## Usage

1. Install our system on your air compressor setup.
2. Configure the settings to match your specific requirements.
3. Sit back and let the automation take care of condensate drainage.
